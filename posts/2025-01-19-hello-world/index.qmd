This is an example post to demonstrate Quarto blogging. Delete this post once you've created your own.

## Quarto Basics

You can write regular markdown, include math like $E = mc^2$, and embed code with syntax highlighting.

## Code Blocks

Use triple backticks with a language name for syntax-highlighted code:

```python
import pandas as pd
import numpy as np

# Create sample data
data = {
    'Category': ['A', 'B', 'C', 'D'],
    'Values': np.random.randint(10, 100, 4)
}
df = pd.DataFrame(data)
df
```

## Executable Code

To make code actually **execute** and show outputs (plots, tables, etc.), add curly braces around the language name: `` ```{python} `` instead of `` ```python ``.

This requires Jupyter. Install with: `pip install jupyter`

## Tips

- **Jupyter notebooks**: Drop `.ipynb` files directly into `posts/` - they render automatically
- **Freeze outputs**: The `freeze: true` setting in `_metadata.yml` caches outputs so code doesn't re-run on every build
- **Categories**: Use the `categories` field for filtering on the blog listing page
- **Drafts**: Set `draft: true` to hide posts from the listing (remove when ready to publish)
