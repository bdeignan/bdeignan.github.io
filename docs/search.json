I’ve led a wide variety of data science projects, from building deep learning models to creating high-performance tools for financial market analysis.\nCurrently, I work on the Public Sector team at Dun & Bradstreet, where I come up with ways to improve our maritime shipping data using NLP and deep learning and build new capabilities to understand foreign influence on businesses.\nWhen I’m not writing Python, I’m usually running, playing soccer, cycling around town, or trying to get better at a new hobby I just picked up."
