Welcome to my personal site. I'm a data scientist with 
a background in economics and computer science. 

I started off learning econometrics in Stata. Then, I 
saw all the fun being had in machine learning and decided to
learn some more things â€“ an Andrew Ng course, 
the Elements of Statistical Learning and much more.

Now I've been programming and analyzing data in Python and 
R for a few years. You can find out more [**about me here**]({% link about.markdown %}). 
And you can check out [**my blog**]({% link blog.markdown %}).
