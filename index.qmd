Principal Data Scientist based in Chicago. I lead AI initiatives and build systems for messy real-world data—LLM extraction pipelines, geospatial analytics at scale, NLP for global trade. Background in econometrics (George Mason) and computer science (UIUC).

Currently at Dun & Bradstreet, previously at Morningstar.

Outside work: running, soccer, cycling, using em dashes before LLMs did.
